# SPIVAE

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

SPIVAE is a machine learning method to study stochastic processes. It
tries to learn the probability distribution of input trajectories and
permits us to interpret its functioning and generate new trajectories
with controllable features.

The approach was initially devised for the paper ‘Learning minimal
representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders’.
We will provide a documented library and detailed tutorials to
facilitate the reproduction of our research findings.
